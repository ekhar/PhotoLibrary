# PhotoLibrary

Using sorting algorithms, gui's, and object oriented design, this project displays and sorts the images
in the images folder inside a gui.

From here, if you click on any given image it will appear on the right hand side as the largest image. There
are options to change each photo's rating, sort by their features, and even scroll through which image appears
the largest on the right by clicking "Previous" and "Next"
