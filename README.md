# PhotoLibrary

Using sorting algorithms, gui's, and object oriented design, this project displays and sorts the images
in the images folder inside a gui.

Clicking on any given image will make it appear on the right as the largest image. There are options to 
change each photo's rating, sort by their features, and scroll through which image appears on the right 
by clicking "Previous" and "Next"

This was an in school project that was given out over the course of 5 weeks as homework. All of the code
was written by me or found from sources online. The teacher's provided a basic outline and let the students
choose their direction on how to implement the code each week.
